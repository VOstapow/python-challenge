Module 3 Challenge - Python

For this assignment, I completed two challenges: 
  one to analyze the banks financial records and determine profit/loses.
  one to analyze the poll data and determine the votes count per candidate and who wo.
  
I utilized the Python methods we learned on Module 3
  variables, conditionals, and loops
  reading a CSV file
  reading a text file
  writing a text file
  
From the Deep Dive into Phyton, I learned to utilize data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
On this journey, I also found how to use the collections module to count the votes per candidate.

This was a very rewarding challenge.
